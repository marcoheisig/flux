1. Initialize MPI done
    -> pass rank and num_procs to all others (done through FileReader :P)
2. Split grid among MPI Ranks (stripes) + borders
    -> write transfer function of boundary cells to neighbors
3. Init grid locally + borders
    -> at beginnen every rank has same data (done)
    -> at end stream all data to rank0
4. SORSolver parallelisieren:
    Residual
    solve
    setBoundary
5. blocking
